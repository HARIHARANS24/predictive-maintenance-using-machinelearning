# Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

The **Predictive Maintenance system** leverages machine learning models to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. This project uses historical data of machinery performance (such as sensor data, maintenance records, and operational status) to predict when equipment is likely to fail, helping organizations minimize downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance operational efficiency.

The solution includes **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **deployment for real-time predictions**.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: 
  - Python

- **Machine Learning Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For model training and evaluation.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn`: For data visualization.

- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - Regression Models: 
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
    - Linear Regression
  - Classification Models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Time-Series Forecasting (optional for time-dependent predictions)

- **Backend (optional)**:
  - `Flask` / `Django` for API deployment (if creating a web-based solution)

- **Data Storage (optional)**:
  - `SQLite` / `MySQL` / `PostgreSQL` for storing maintenance data (optional for real-time usage)

- **Deployment (optional)**:
  - `Docker` for containerization (if deploying as a service)
  - AWS / GCP / Azure for cloud deployment

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
  - Import and preprocess historical data for model training, including sensor data, maintenance records, and operational status.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: 
  - Train machine learning models to predict equipment failures based on historical input features. 
  - Evaluate models using various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- **Predictive Insights**: 
  - Generate predictions on when an asset is likely to fail based on historical data.

- **Maintenance Scheduling**: 
  - Provide actionable insights and recommendations for when to perform maintenance to avoid unplanned downtimes.

- **Real-Time Prediction (optional)**: 
  - Deploy models for real-time predictions based on new, incoming data.

- **Model Accuracy and Evaluation**: 
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- **Visualization**: 
  - Visualize data insights and model predictions using charts to detect patterns and trends in machinery performance.
