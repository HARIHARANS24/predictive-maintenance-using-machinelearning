Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning
The Predictive Maintenance system leverages machine learning models to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. This project uses historical data of machinery performance (such as sensor data, maintenance records, and operational status) to predict when equipment is likely to fail, helping organizations minimize downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance operational efficiency.

The solution includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment for real-time predictions.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Libraries:

scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation.

pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

numpy: For numerical operations.

matplotlib / seaborn: For data visualization.

Modeling Techniques:

Regression Models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or Linear Regression)

Classification Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM)

Time-Series Forecasting (optional for time-dependent predictions)

Backend:

Flask/Django (optional) for API deployment (if creating a web-based solution)

Data Storage:

SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL for storing maintenance data (optional for real-time usage)

Deployment:

Docker for containerization (if deploying as a service)

AWS/GCP/Azure for cloud deployment (optional)

Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Import and preprocess historical data for model training.

Model Training and Evaluation: Train machine learning models to predict equipment failures based on input features.

Predictive Insights: Generate predictions on when an asset is likely to fail.

Maintenance Scheduling: Provide recommendations for when to perform maintenance to avoid unplanned downtimes.

Real-time Prediction: (Optional) Deploy models to provide real-time predictions based on new data.

Model Accuracy and Evaluation: Evaluate model performance with metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Visualization: Visualize data insights using charts to detect patterns and trends in machinery performance.
