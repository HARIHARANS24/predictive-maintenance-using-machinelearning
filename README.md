# Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

The **Predictive Maintenance system** leverages machine learning models to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. This project uses historical data of machinery performance (such as sensor data, maintenance records, and operational status) to predict when equipment is likely to fail, helping organizations minimize downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance operational efficiency.

The solution includes **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **deployment for real-time predictions**.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: 
  - Python

- **Machine Learning Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For model training and evaluation.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn`: For data visualization.

- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - Regression Models: 
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
    - Linear Regression
  - Classification Models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Time-Series Forecasting (optional for time-dependent predictions)

- **Backend (optional)**:
  - `Flask` / `Django` for API deployment (if creating a web-based solution)

- **Data Storage (optional)**:
  - `SQLite` / `MySQL` / `PostgreSQL` for storing maintenance data (optional for real-time usage)

- **Deployment (optional)**:
  - `Docker` for containerization (if deploying as a service)
  - AWS / GCP / Azure for cloud deployment

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
  - Import and preprocess historical data for model training, including sensor data, maintenance records, and operational status.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: 
  - Train machine learning models to predict equipment failures based on historical input features. 
  - Evaluate models using various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- **Predictive Insights**: 
  - Generate predictions on when an asset is likely to fail based on historical data.

- **Maintenance Scheduling**: 
  - Provide actionable insights and recommendations for when to perform maintenance to avoid unplanned downtimes.

- **Real-Time Prediction (optional)**: 
  - Deploy models for real-time predictions based on new, incoming data.

- **Model Accuracy and Evaluation**: 
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- **Visualization**: 
  - Visualize data insights and model predictions using charts to detect patterns and trends in machinery performance.

Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+ (Recommended version)

pip (Python package installer)

Jupyter Notebook (Optional, for interactive analysis)

Docker (Optional, for containerization)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive-maintenance.git
cd predictive-maintenance
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you're using Jupyter Notebooks, launch Jupyter:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Data Preprocessing
Load and preprocess the data in the data/raw_data.csv file. The data_preprocessing.py script will handle data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.

Ensure that the dataset is split into training and test sets. This can be done using functions in data_preprocessing.py.

Model Training
Open the notebooks/model_training.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to explore and train the models.

Choose the desired model(s) (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or Linear Regression).

Train the model(s) on the preprocessed data and evaluate the performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Real-Time Prediction (Optional)
If you'd like to deploy the model for real-time predictions, use the real_time_prediction.ipynb notebook to integrate with a real-time data source (e.g., sensor data).

Alternatively, use the api.py script to deploy the model via a Flask or Django API endpoint.

Docker (Optional)
If you'd like to containerize the project for deployment, build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t predictive-maintenance .
docker run -p 5000:5000 predictive-maintenance
API Endpoints (Optional)
Predictions
POST /api/predict:

Input: JSON data containing the features of the equipment.

Output: Predicted failure time or failure probability.

Model Evaluation
GET /api/evaluate:

Input: N/A (model evaluation is based on the test dataset).

Output: Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Evaluation Metrics
Evaluate the models using the following metrics:

Precision: The fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances.

Recall: The fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances.

F1-Score: A balanced measure of precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix: A table that allows visualization of the performance of the model.

Visualization
Visualize the training and testing data to observe any patterns and trends.

Use matplotlib and seaborn for plotting graphs such as feature importance, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.
